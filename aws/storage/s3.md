## AWS S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a popular cloud storage that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 

Its a fully managed service.

When talking about Amazon S3 there are some concepts:

- **Buckets**: These are directories and have a globally unique name
- **Objects**: These are files that have a key and this key is the full path. For example s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt

The maximum size of an object is 5TB and if the upload is larger than 5GB the multipart upload must be used.

- **Versioning**: Enabled at the bucket level. The same key overwrites and increments the version: 1, 2, 3… It’s the best practice to version your files. Under “Properties” of the bucket, you can enable this.
- **S3** can also maintain static websites and make them available on the internet. If the return is an HTTP 403 (forbidden), it’s good to look at the policy and make sure it allows public access.

## S3 Storage Classes
There are different types of storage classes in S3 that mainly drives how the pricing will work.

### Amazon S3 Standard
- This class is used for general purposes;
- 99.999999999% object resiliency across multiple Availability Zones;
- Used for data that will be accessed frequently.

### Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

This is a very interesting case. This storage class automatically reduces storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective tier based on the frequency of access.

For example, an object can be moved to a low access layer, for reasons of low access in everyday life. If this object is later accessed, it will be moved back to the frequently accessed tier.

- The durability of 99.999999999% of objects in multiple Availability Zones;
- It has a small monthly charge for monitoring and automatic levels;

### Amazon S3 Standard — Infrequent Access

- Used for data that has a lower frequency of access but requires fast access when needed;
- 99.99% availability;
- Lower cost compared to S3 Standard;
- Used for disaster recovery backups.

### Amazon S3 One Zone

- Used for infrequently accessed data;
- It has a durability of 99.999999999% in a single AZ (availability zone);
- Used to store a secondary backup of copies of on-premises data, or data that can be recreated.

### Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

- Class used to archive things, so it has a low cost;
- Data storage here must be at least 90 days long;
- Millisecond recovery is great for data accessed once a quarter.

### Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval

- It’s also a class used to archive things, so it’s low cost;
- Data storage here must also be at least 90 days long;
- Suitable for data that can be accessed 1 or 2 times a year and retrieved asynchronously;
- Recovery times from minutes to hours.

### Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive

- It has a data recovery time of up to 12 hours, being suitable for data that can be accessed 1 or 2 times a year;
- Provides 99.999999999% object resiliency across multiple Availability Zones;
- Data recovery can take up to 12 hours.
